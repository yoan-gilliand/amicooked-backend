# SQLite Database Directory

This directory is intentionally left empty.

At runtime, an SQLite database file will be automatically created here when the application starts.

## Notes

- Do not manually add files to this folder.
- Ensure this directory exists and is writable by the application.
- The database filename and structure will be initialized by the app based on its configuration.

## Git

If using Git, you can keep this folder tracked by adding an empty `.gitkeep` file.
